## Solution 1: Cloud Build (Recommended) ‚≠ê

### GitHub Actions Automated Build
I'll set up a GitHub Actions workflow that builds your APK automatically:

1. **Push code to GitHub** (if not already there)
2. **GitHub Actions builds APK** on every commit
3. **Download APK** from GitHub releases
4. **Copy to your Replit** downloads folder

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ No local Java setup needed
- ‚úÖ Builds work 100% reliably
- ‚úÖ Can build for multiple Android architectures
- ‚úÖ Automatic builds on code changes
- ‚úÖ Free for public repositories

Would you like me to create the GitHub Actions workflow file?

## Solution 3: Local Development Environment

If you have access to a local machine:

# Clone your Replit project
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gabai.git
cd gabai

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build web app
npm run build

# Sync with Capacitor
npx cap sync android

# Open in Android Studio
npx cap open android

# Build APK (in Android Studio)
# Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)
```

## Solution 4: Replit Java Fix (Advanced)

If you want to build directly in Replit:

```bash
# Set Java environment (run each time)
export JAVA_HOME=/nix/store/$(ls /nix/store | grep openjdk-17)/
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

# Verify Java
java -version

# Build APK
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug --no-daemon

# Copy to downloads
cp app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk ../public/downloads/gabai-beta.apk
```
