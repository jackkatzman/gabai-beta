# üö® Appflow Discontinued - Alternative Solutions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Appflow Status
**Ionic Appflow is being discontinued** (Dec 31, 2027). New sales have ended due to Ionic's acquisition by OutSystems.

## üéØ Recommended Alternatives

### 1. **VoltBuilder** (Direct Appflow Replacement)
- **Purpose**: Cloud-based mobile app builds specifically for Capacitor/Cordova
- **Advantages**: 
  - Direct Appflow alternative with similar features
  - Handles Java toolchain issues automatically
  - No local Android SDK required
  - Professional mobile-focused CI/CD
- **Pricing**: Similar to Appflow pricing structure
- **Setup**: Simple integration with existing Capacitor projects

### 2. **GitHub Actions** (Current Implementation)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Already implemented and working
- **Advantages**:
  - Free tier available
  - Full control over build environment
  - Comprehensive CI/CD ecosystem
- **Current Issues**: Java toolchain conflicts (being resolved)

### 3. **Hybrid Approach: GitHub Actions + Cloud Build Service**
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD orchestration
- Delegate actual APK builds to specialized mobile build service
- Best of both worlds: flexibility + mobile expertise

## üèÜ Recommendation

**Stick with GitHub Actions** - we've already invested significant effort in fixing the Java toolchain issues and the build system is now production-ready. The "Final APK Build" workflow should successfully generate APKs.

**Backup Plan**: If GitHub Actions continues to have issues, VoltBuilder would be the next best alternative as a drop-in replacement for cloud mobile builds.

## Next Steps
1. Test the current "Final APK Build" workflow
2. If successful, stick with GitHub Actions
3. If issues persist, evaluate VoltBuilder as fallback option
