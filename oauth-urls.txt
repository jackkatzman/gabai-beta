Google OAuth Callback URLs for GabAi

Current Working Configuration:
https://gab-ai-jack741.replit.app/api/auth/google/callback

URLs for Google Cloud Console:
1. https://gab-ai-jack741.replit.app/api/auth/google/callback (production)
2. http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/callback (development)

Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Remove any existing invalid URLs first
2. Copy the URL exactly (no spaces)
3. Make sure you're in the correct OAuth client
4. Try adding one URL at a time
5. Check that the OAuth client type is "Web application"

If the long Replit URL doesn't work, we can:
- Set up a shorter custom domain
- Use localhost for development testing
- Configure the OAuth for production domain instead
