# Android Build System Analysis

## Current Status: DEBUGGING ACTIVE BUILD FAILURES

The GitHub Actions builds are failing consistently across multiple workflows. This is a comprehensive diagnosis to identify and fix the root causes.

## Build Configuration Summary

### Current Toolchain
- **Gradle**: 8.9-bin 
- **Android Gradle Plugin**: 8.7.2 (compatible)
- **Java**: 21 (aligned with Capacitor requirements)
- **compileSdk/targetSdk**: 35 (required for AndroidX dependencies)
- **minSdk**: 23 (modern baseline)

### Project Structure Analysis
- Uses legacy `buildscript{}` approach due to Capacitor project structure
- Has `variables.gradle` with version definitions
- Multiple Capacitor plugins as dependencies
- Core library desugaring enabled for Java 21 compatibility

## Recent Changes Made
1. Reverted to `buildscript{}` syntax instead of `plugins{}` - Capacitor projects require legacy approach
2. Removed `kotlinOptions{}` block causing compilation issues
3. Created clean diagnostic build workflow with detailed logging
4. Disabled conflicting old workflows (moved to disabled folder)

## Next Steps
1. Run clean diagnostic build to identify exact failure points
2. Fix any remaining version conflicts
3. Ensure Capacitor sync creates proper Android project structure
4. Test minimal APK build with full logging

## Expected Outcome
With proper configuration alignment, the build should succeed and produce working APKs for both debug and release variants.
