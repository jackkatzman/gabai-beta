gh run list --workflow="Cordova APK Build (No Capacitor)"
```

## What These Builds Do

### Manual Gradle Build (Recommended)
âœ… **Pure Android Studio Build** - Bypasses ALL framework conflicts (Cordova + Capacitor)
âœ… **Latest Android SDK** - Uses SDK 35 for maximum compatibility
âœ… **Fastest Build Time** - 2-3 minutes typical completion
âœ… **Direct WebView** - Clean implementation without framework overhead

### Cordova Build (Backup)
âœ… **Pure Cordova Build** - Bypasses Capacitor Java 21 conflicts
âœ… **Framework Approach** - Traditional mobile app packaging
âœ… **Stable Fallback** - If manual build has issues

## Build Artifacts

### Manual Gradle Build
- **APK File**: `gabai-manual-debug.apk`
- **Technology**: Pure Android Studio + WebView
- **Build Time**: ~3 minutes

### Cordova Build  
- **APK File**: `gabai-cordova-debug.apk`
- **Technology**: Cordova framework
- **Build Time**: ~5 minutes

Both provide:
- **Build Logs**: Detailed execution information
- **30-day retention**: Artifacts stored for a month

## Troubleshooting

**Can't find the workflow?**
- Make sure the files are pushed to your main branch
- Check that `.github/workflows/cordova-only-build.yml` exists in your repository

**Build fails?**
- Check the build logs in the Actions tab
- Look for error messages in the workflow execution details
- The isolated build should avoid most common issues

**Need help?**
- Build logs provide detailed information about any failures
- The fallback HTML ensures you get an APK even if web assets aren't found

## Success Indicators

âœ… Green checkmark in Actions tab
âœ… APK file appears in Artifacts section  
âœ… Build logs show "Cordova APK build completed successfully"
âœ… APK size is reasonable (2-10MB typically)

Your first working Android APK is ready to build!
